    This data is being collected through OpenPATH, an NREL open-sourced platform.
    The smart phone application, NREL OpenPATH (“App”), combines data from
    smartphone sensors, semantic user labels and a short demographic survey.

    NREL is a national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of
    Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, operated by Alliance for Sustainable
    Energy, LLC under Prime Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308. This Privacy Policy
    applies to the App provided by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC. This App
    is provided solely for the purposes of collecting travel behavior data for the
    {{ui_config.intro.program_or_study}} and for research to inform public policy.
    None of the data collected by the App will never be sold or used for any
    commercial purposes, including advertising.

    IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DELETE THE APP

    <h3>Why we collect this information</h3>
    {{template_text.why_we_collect}}
    
    <h3>What information we collect</h3>
    <p>
    The App will never ask for any Personally Identifying Information (PII) such as
    name, email, address, or phone number.
    </p><p>
    ລະບົບນີ້ຈະນໍາໃຊ້ ເພື່ອເປັນການເກັບກໍາຂໍ້ມູນໃນການຕິດຕາມ ການເດີນທາງ ເພື່ອໃຫ້ເຂົ້າເຖີງຮູບແບບການເດີນທາງຂອງການນໍາໃຊ້ພາຫະນະ.

    It will also ask you to periodically annotate these sensed trips with semantic
    labels, such as the trip mode, purpose, and replaced mode.
    </p><p>
    It will also request sociodemographic information such as your approximate age,
    gender, and household type. The sociodemographic factors can be used to
    understand the influence of lifestyle on travel behavior, as well as generalize
    the results to a broader population.
    </p><p>
    For the greatest transparency, the App is based on an open source platform,
    NREL’s OpenPATH. you can inspect the data that OpenPATH collects in the background at

    You are logging in with a randomly generated 'opcode' that has been generated by the
    platform. This long random string will used for all further communication with
    the server. Only you know the opcode that is associated with you. There is no
    “Forgot password” option, and NREL staff cannot retrieve your opcode, even if
    you provide your name or email address. This means that, unless you store your
    opcode in a safe place, you will not have access to your prior data if you
    switch phones or uninstall and reinstall the App.
    </div>
    
    <h3>Who gets to see the information</h3>
    <p>
    Aggregate metrics derived from the travel patterns will be made available on a public dashboard to provide transparency into the impact of the program. These metrics will focus on information summaries such as counts, distances and durations, and will not display individual travel locations or times.
    </p><p>
    Individual labeling rates and trip level information will only be made available to:
    <ul>
        <li> 🧑 Program administrators from {{ui_config.intro.deployment_partner_name}} to {{template_text.raw_data_use}}, and
        <li> 💻 NREL OpenPATH developers for debugging
    </ul>
    </p><p>
    The data will also be periodically archived in NREL’s Transportation Secure
    Data Center (TSDC) after a delay of 3 to 6 months. It will then be made
    available for legitimate research through existing, privacy-preserving TSDC
    operating procedures. Further information on the procedures is available <a href="https://nrel.gov/tsdc">on the
    website</a> and in <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146515002999">this publication</a> and <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/70723.pdf">fact sheet</a>.

    <h3>Your rights</h3>
    <p>
    <div ng-if="ui_config.intro.app_required">
    You are required to track your travel patterns using the App as a condition of
    participation in the Program. If you wish to withdraw from the Program, you
    should contact the program administrator,
    {{ui_config.intro.program_admin_contact}}  to discuss termination options. If you
    wish to stay in the program but not use the app, please contact your program
    administrator to negotiate an alternative data collection procedure before
    uninstalling the app. If you uninstall the app without approval from the
    program administrator, you may not have access to the benefits provided by the
    program.

    <div ng-if="!ui_config.intro.app_required">
    Participation in the {{ui_config.intro.program_or_study}} is completely
    voluntary. You have the right to decline to participate or to withdraw at any
    point in the Study without providing notice to NREL or the point of contact. If
    you do not wish to participate in the Study or to discontinue your
    participation in the Study, please delete the App.

    </p><p>
    If you would like to have your data destroyed, please contact K. Shankari
    (<a href="mailto:k.shankari@nrel.gov">k.shankari@nrel.gov</a>) requesting deletion.
    You must include your token in the request for deletion. Because we do not
    connect your identity with your token, we cannot delete your information
    without obtaining the token as part of the deletion request. We will then
    destroy all data associated with that deletion request, both in the online and
    archived datasets.

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    If you have any questions about the data collection goals and results, please
